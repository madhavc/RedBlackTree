RedBlackTree
============

This is my implementation of the RedBlackTree in java. 

The RedBlackTree has been implemented using generics which can take in type of object for the Key and Value. The value of the Key must be comparable. 

The pretty printing method is implemented to print the keys and the color of the nodes in a tree like format. ,
